# Flutter-Assessment
Payment processing involves several components / services. One of such is determining the processing fee to charge per transaction. This assessment is about implementing an NGN (Nigerian Naira) fee processing service for a fictional Payment Processor (LannisterPay).

LannisterPay has reached out to you to help implement a transaction fee processing service. This service is meant to calculate the fee applicable to a transaction based on specific fee configurations they will share with you.

LannisterPay uses a custom fee configuration spec (FCS) to describe applicable fees.
